# Number Logic – Game Rules & Modes

## 🎯 Objective
Deduce and find the **secret 4-digit sequence** within the allowed number of attempts.  
The fewer attempts you use → **the higher your score**.

---

## ⚙️ Basic Setup
- Default length: **6 digits** (can be adjusted in Settings).
- You can enable/disable **Hints** and **Timer** in Settings.
- Digits can **repeat or not** depending on the mode (default: **no repeats** for more logical deduction).

---

## 📜 Game Rules
1. **Enter a sequence** and press **Submit** (or **Lock** in 2-player mode).
2. Get feedback for each guess:
   - **✓ (Correct)**: right digit in the right position.
   - **≈ (Close)**: right digit but wrong position.
   - **× (Wrong)**: digit not in the answer.
3. Use the feedback history to **narrow down possibilities** and adjust your next guess.
4. **Round ends** when:
   - You guess the full sequence correctly, or
   - You run out of attempts / the timer runs out (if Timer is enabled).

## 🏆 Scoring (Suggested)
- Base score = **depends on difficulty level**.
- Bonus points for **fewer attempts**.
- Extra speed bonus if playing with Timer.
- Consecutive wins (win-streak) give a **combo bonus**.

## 🎮 Game Modes

### 1. **Solo Mode** (Practice / Timed)
- Choose **Practice** (no timer) or **Timed** (countdown).
- Track: **Timer • Score • Attempts**.
- Limited **Hints** available (adjustable in Settings).

### 2. **Two-Player Mode** (Versus – Hotseat or Online)
- **Take turns** entering guesses.
- **Match Log** shows both players’ guesses and results.
- Win a round by solving the sequence.
- Win the match by **Best of N** (default: 3).

---

## 💡 Quick Tips
- **First guess**: use 4 different digits to get more feedback.
- Prioritize elimination: if a digit is marked “×”, don’t use it again in later guesses.
- For “≈”, try **swapping positions** intelligently in the next guess.

- **Yellow / ≈**: correct digit, wrong position.
